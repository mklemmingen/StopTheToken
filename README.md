# StopTheToken
pihole blocklist for ai-generated websites. community-fed -> add to it! 

If you have any reason to believe that a website may be using ai-generation excessively for whatever unlegitimate reason, simply add the website to the blocklist.txt and create a pull request explaining your reasoning. 

Add to your pi-hole / dns blocker of your choice via:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mklemmingen/StopTheToken/main/blocklist.txt

Rules for adding:
    - Each line should contain only one domain.
    - Avoid adding comments in the same line as a domain.If needed, you can use a separate file for explanations or place comments in the README.
    - The list should not include protocol prefixes (http://, https://) or paths (/page). Only the domain names or subdomains.
